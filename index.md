# Title

Shopping List App

## Completeness

Shopping list seems complete with nessecary features like adding, removing, and editing items on the shopping list.

## Clarity

With a simple design and features, clarity doesn't seem like a problem as the mobile app doesn't seem to complex and has a straightforward purpose.

## Feasibility

Item recommendations with the use of data analytics seem too out of reach for the simplicity and function of the app and would require further programming skill and knowledge. 

## Scalibility

With MariaDB and Firebase, it seems rather scalable but seems that the item recommendations may cause issues.

## Maintainability

Node.js and Firebase are widely used, making it relatively easy to maintain the program.

## Security

Security doesn't seem to have any issues except item recommendations invading privacy depending on how aggressive the data collection is.
